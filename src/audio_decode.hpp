// Song audio decoded while it plays.
//
// The S2X engine reads a chart while the song plays instead of all of it
// first; this does the same for audio, the slow part here (the charts load
// at hundreds of MB per second). A file is opened, its length read from the
// header and the song starts at once: a background thread decodes it in
// blocks, first where the song plays, then the rest. Tracks too long to keep
// whole (S2X's discarded chunks) keep only the minutes around the play
// position, so an 8-hour song needs a few MB.
