// AutoChart: makes a playable FNF-style chart from any song's audio, so a
// folder with just an Inst.ogg (or a lone .mp3 in songs/) can be played.
// Onsets come from spectral flux, the tempo from the onset envelope's
// autocorrelation; notes are snapped to the beat grid, thinned per
// difficulty, spread across lanes by pitch and traded between the opponent
// and the player every four bars.
