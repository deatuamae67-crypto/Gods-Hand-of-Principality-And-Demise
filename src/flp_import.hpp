// FL Studio projects (.flp) and scores (.fsc) as charts, read the way SNIFF
// (SiIva Note Importer For FNF, https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/SNIFF)
// reads them: the notes of one pattern of the FPC channel (the first channel
// without one), with C3-D#3 (pitches 48-51) as the player's lanes and C4-D#4
// (60-63) as the opponent's; F3 (53) and F#3 (54) point the camera at the
// player or the opponent from that section on; A3 (57) and A#3 (58) give the
// section's opponent or player notes their alt animation. A note held for a
// beat or more, or played softly (velocity under 64), becomes a hold.
